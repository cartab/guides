%p
  Our <em>Rapid Application Deployment</em> stack allows you to deploy any Rails or Rack application as easy as pushing a git change you made. You just have to install Webbynode's gem and run a couple of commands, based on the same git workflow you're used to.

  Once you submit your app for deployment, all the dirty work will be done behind the scenes for you.
