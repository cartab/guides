h1. <%= h(@page.title) %>

h2. Start/Stop/Reboot

You can easily perform this operations on the Webby where your application is deployed:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn reboot
Are you sure you wish to restart your webby? (y/n)
y
webby3067 will now be rebooted!
<% end -%>

The same can be done for <code>stop</code> and <code>start</code> commands.
