h2. Publishing

When publishing your application, the Rapid App Engine will transfer all the code to your Webby, set up the database, the DNS entries (if applicable), configure the Web Server (Apache2 or nginx) and setup additional features (like backup) that we'll see later.

Before starting your first publishing there's something you can do to make upcoming deployments a little easier. You can add your SSH key to your Webby's deployment user.

Hard? Not really. We have a command for that: <code>add_key</code>. Just go ahead and run this:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ wn add_key
Enter your deployment password for xx.xx.xx.xx: 
Your local SSH Key has been added to your webby!
<% end -%>

With that done, it should be the last time we prompt you for a password (at least until you change to another machine).

Let's now deploy the application with the <code>push</code> command:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ webbynode push
